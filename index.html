            <dt>About me</dt>
            <dd>
                I am a lecturer in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics in the 
		    College of Natural and Mathematical Sciences at the University 
		    of Maryland Baltimore County (UMBC). I have been at UMBC since Fall 2024. 
		    Prior to that I spent twelve years teaching in the Middle East, 
		    primarily at Zayed University, along with 
		    holding a visiting professor postion at the University of the Virgin Islands 
		    and a posistion as an instructor at the University of Arizona.

            <dt>Research</dt>
            <dd>
                Broadly speaking, my scholarly interests mainly focus teaching and pedagogy. 
		    First, I am interested in pedagogy and expository writing and have 
		    published two undergraduate-level textbooks and am currently finishing 
		    the third. The first was published in 2018, the second in 2020, and the 
		    third will be published in Fall 2024. Second, I am interested in 
		    effective and interesting methods to teach mathematics and to assess and 
		    evaluate learning. 

		    Finally, I am interested in the pedagogy of teaching all levels of geometry. 
		    Euclidâ€™s Elements of Geometry reigned as the canonical text on geometry for 
		    two thousand years until the nineteenth century brought the realization that 
		    there are numerous examples of non-Euclidian geometries (projective, inversive, 
		    affine, hyperbolic, and elliptic geometries.) In 1872 Felix Klein provided a 
		    unifying theoretical framework which resulted in a single classification system 
		    for these disparate geometries. This was achieved by viewing each geometry as a 
		    space together with a group of transformations of the space. Indeed, these 
		    geometric transformations play an important role in art and graphic design. 
		    Tessellations, repeating patters, and symmetry of any kind, are graphical 
		    representations of underlying mathematical transformations.  It is my hope that 
		    this will be the subject matter for a future book.
