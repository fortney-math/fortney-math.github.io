            <dt>About me</dt>
            <dd>
                I am a lecturer in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics in the 
		    College of Natural and Mathematical Sciences at the University 
		    of Maryland Baltimore County (UMBC) with over twenty years of teaching 
		    experience. I have been at UMBC since Fall 2024. 
		    Prior to that I spent twelve years teaching in the Middle East, 
		    primarily at Zayed University, along with 
		    holding a visiting professor postion at the University of the Virgin Islands 
		    and a posistion as an instructor at the University of Arizona.

            <dd>
                Broadly speaking, my scholarly interests mainly focus teaching and pedagogy. 
		    First, I am interested in pedagogy and expository writing and have 
		    published two undergraduate-level textbooks and have finished 
		    the third. The first was published in 2018, the second in 2020, and the 
		    third will be published in Fall 2024. Second, I am interested in 
		    effective and interesting methods to teach mathematics and to assess and 
		    evaluate learning. 
	     </dd>
	     <dd>
		    In particular, I am interested in the pedagogy of teaching all levels of geometry. 
		    Euclid’s Elements of Geometry reigned as the canonical text on geometry for 
		    two thousand years until the nineteenth century brought the realization that 
		    there are numerous examples of non-Euclidian geometries (projective, inversive, 
		    affine, hyperbolic, and elliptic geometries.) In 1872 Felix Klein provided a 
		    unifying theoretical framework which resulted in a single classification system 
		    for these disparate geometries. This was achieved by viewing each geometry as a 
		    space together with a group of transformations of the space. Indeed, these 
		    geometric transformations play an important role in art and graphic design. 
		    Tessellations, repeating patters, and symmetry of any kind, are graphical 
		    representations of underlying mathematical transformations.  It is my hope that 
		    this will be the subject matter for a future book.

			Calculus on Manifolds &rdquo;</i>,
                        Birkhauser Press, 2018
			    
			<p>
			This book explains and helps readers to develop geometric 
			    intuition as it relates to differential forms. It includes 
			    over 250 figures to aid understanding and enable readers 
			    to visualize the concepts being discussed. The basic ideas 
			    and concepts are gradually built up so that definitions, when 
			    made, do not appear out of nowhere, and both the importance 
			    and role that theorems play is evident as or before they are 
			    presented. With a clear writing style and easy-to-understand 
			    motivations for each topic, this book is primarily aimed at 
			    second- or third-year undergraduate math and physics students 
			    with a basic knowledge of vector calculus and linear algebra.

			<p>
			This book is intended for a first- or second-year discrete 
			    mathematics course for computer science majors. It covers 
			    many important mathematical topics essential for future 
			    computer science majors, such as algorithms, number 
			    representations, logic, set theory, Boolean algebra, functions, 
			    combinatorics, algorithmic complexity, graphs, and trees.

			<p>
			Calculus for Business and Economics: An Example-Based Introduction 
			    is a calculus book exclusively intended for first-year university 
			    students majoring in business and economics. As such, this book 
			    is unique in several important ways. Unlike most calculus books 
			    currently used for business calculus classes, this book exclusively 
			    focuses on business and economics applications. This focus allows 
			    for an exceptionally clean, succinct, and targeted presentation of 
			    the mathematical material, resulting in an easy-to-read, concise, 
			    and in-depth presentation. Each chapter concludes with a section 
			    illustrating the practical business and economics applications of 
			    the covered mathematical concepts.
